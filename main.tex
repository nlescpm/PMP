\section{Scope and definitions}

\subsection{Scope}

This document is the official project management protocol for the Netherlands eScience Center. It describes all phases
of a project and the procedures required to successfully complete them.

The scope of this document is the execution of research projects awarded by the eScience Center through calls for
proposals, though other types of projects are also briefly covered. This document gives a detailed description of all
steps, both necessary and optional, that must or may be taken in the execution of projects, reflecting the so-called
\textit{project life cycle}. For each step, the document indicates the responsibilities of the project team members
(RSEs) and other eScience Center employees (e.g. Programme Managers, Finances, Directors Team) involved in the
process.


Call procedures follow a separate protocol\cite{call-protocol-2015} and are
not covered by this document. The call procedure protocol ends with the formal awarding of projects by the eScience
Center Governing Board or the Directors Team (DT), the notification of Lead Applicants and the formalization of the
awarding by means of a \textit{toekenningsbrief} ('Awarding letterâ€™). The
current document describes all activities that (need to) take place from that moment onwards, until the formal closing
of the project. An independent evaluation of projects, including impact, output, process and collaboration with project
partners is outside of the scope of the current document, and will be published as a separate document or a subsequent
version of this document in the future. 

This document has been approved by the DT and will be subject to evaluation and possible adaptation annually.

The structure of this document largely follows the project life cycle (see Section~\ref{sec:lifecycle}); the
protocol describes activities in chronological order.
