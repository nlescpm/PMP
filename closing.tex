\section{Project closing}
\label{sec:closing}

Project closing is the final phase of a project. In this phase the PM (with the help of F\&C) processes the end report
and accepts the project deliverables. Once the project is formally closed, RSEs can no longer write hours or work on
this project. 



\subsection{End report}
\label{sec:closing:end}
All completed call projects at the eScience Center must have an end project report.
