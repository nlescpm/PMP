\subsection{Scope}
\label{sec:scope:sc}

This document is the official project management protocol for the Netherlands eScience Center. It describes all phases
of a project and the procedures required to successfully complete them.

The scope of this document is the execution of research projects awarded by the eScience Center through calls for
proposals, though other types of projects are also briefly covered. This document gives a detailed description of all
steps, both required and optional, that must or may be taken in the execution of projects, reflecting the so-called
\textit{project life cycle}. For each step, the document clarifies the responsibilities of the project team members
(RSEs) and other eScience Center employees (e.g. Programme Managers, Finance, Directors Team) involved in the
process.

Call procedures are governed by a separate protocol~\cite{call-protocol-2015} and fall outside the scope of this document. 
The call procedure protocol ends with the formal awarding of projects by the eScience
Center Governing Board or the Directors Team (DT), the notification of Lead Applicants and the formalization of the
awarding by means of a \textit{toekenningsbrief} ('Awarding letter’). 
The current document covers all subsequent activities that (need to) take place after the awarding until the formal closing
of the project. An independent evaluation of projects focused on impact, output, process, and 
collaboration with project partners, falls outside the scope of this document and will be addressed in a separate publication or a future revision.
Tools and platforms used for project management (e.g. \href{https://www.ganttic.com/}{Ganttic}, \href{https://www.exact.com/}{Exact}) as well as standard techniques
(cf.~\cite{pmpm:31,brooks1995mythical,demarco2016peopleware,the_turing_way-2023,intro:2025talk}), are only briefly referenced and are not described in detail in this protocol.
This document has been approved by the DT and will be subject to evaluation and possible adaptation annually.

The structure of this document largely follows the project life cycle (see Section~\ref{sec:scope:lifecycle}); the
protocol describes activities in chronological order.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
An eScience project is a project involving the eScience Center, where responsibility is shared between different
stakeholders who each have their own roles and responsibilities during specific phases of the project.

\subsection{Types of projects}
The eScience Center receives an annual budget from \href{https://www.nwo.nl/}{NWO} and \href{https://www.surf.nl/}{SURF}, the larger part of which is allocated to projects
submitted by researchers working at eligible research performing organizations in the Netherlands in the form of the
in-kind provision of RSEs. Projects may also be \href{https://research-software-directory.org/organisations/netherlands-escience-center?categories=%5B%22External%22%5D&tab=projects}{funded from external sources} (henceforth referred to as \textit{an
external project) }or funded from the annual budget but carried out internally.

By awarding subsidy to a project or by pledging a contribution to an external project, the eScience Center takes on the
obligation to deliver high-quality work in a timely manner.

\subsubsection{Call projects}
The eScience Center publishes a range of calls. Each project is a part of a specific call (regular calls such as
\href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6602691}{OEC}, \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10865584}{SS}, \href{10.5281/zenodo.5163292}{SSI}, or \href{https://research-software-directory.org/organisations/netherlands-escience-center?categories=%5B%22Collaborative%20Calls%22%5D&tab=projects}{calls in collaboration with other funders} such as \href{https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2019-32775.html}{Big Data \& Health}, 
\href{https://www.nwo-i.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/JCER-call-2017_UK.pdf}{JCER}, \href{https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2019-54263.html}{ESI-FAR}). Projects from the regular calls before 2021 are partly in-cash, while projects awarded later
are fully in-kind (plus a reserved budget for workshops).

Calls can reserve part of the project or the call budget to serve the eScience Center agenda to increase the impact of
software beyond the project itself. Henceforth this will be referred to as the software sustainability budget, formerly
known as generalization budget). The budget is intended for software generalization, reuse and sustainability, and
community building. The DoT is the holder of this budget. Details concerning this budget are included in the Awarding
letter. See Section~\ref{sec:opportunities:ss} for more information.

Project teams (mainly Lead RSE, PM and TL) are expected to consult legal documents such as the specific call text, Awarding letter
(‘Toekenningsbrief’), Terms and Conditions document (‘Bijzondere voorwaarden’, ‘Subsidieregeling’, etc.), Consortium/Collaboration Agreement (CA), and/or
contracts for grant terms and conditions. The LA is responsible for adhering to the conditions of the project, while
the PM, with the help of the Lead RSE, monitors this.

In our call projects, most of the total requested budget is dedicated to project work and project-related activities.
The remaining part (referred to as “general activities”) covers activities that benefit our ability to contribute to
high-quality research, such as the professional development of RSEs through training, work meetings, conferences, etc,
as well as the administrative coordination and project management within the eScience Center. It is up to the PMs and
RSEs in consultation with the SHs to fairly distribute hours for general activities across all the projects they
contribute to (cf. Section~\ref{sec:exec:budget}). The exact percentage set aside for general activities is defined in
the call within which a project has been awarded.

\subsubsection{External projects}
Projects funded externally by e.g. NWO or the EU, or via private-public partnerships, are governed by external funding
conditions specified in a contract or agreement that may supersede our own rules. %The budgets of these projects need to be approved by Finance and the DoO. 
The LA is responsible for adherence to these rules and conditions, while the Lead RSE monitors this. 
Again, the project team (mostly, Lead RSE, PM, TL) must consult the specific call
text and other formal documents (Awarding letter, Terms and Conditions document, Consortium/Collaboration Agreements, contracts for the conditions
and rules). Projects under external funding are covered partially by this protocol. The formalities around the acquisition process follow the workflow described in “External funding” (see Section
\ref{sec:opportunities:external-funding} for more information).

\subsubsection{Other projects}
This document only briefly covers other types of projects such as those funded through Ambition 2~\cite{nlesc-strategy}, namely Dissemination
\& Community (D\&C), Knowledge \& Development (KD) and Fellowship projects in 
Section~\ref{sec:opportunities:fellowship} and Appendix~\ref{app:pm-role}.

\subsection{Project life cycle overview}

\end{figure}

At the eScience Center, a standard project life cycle is a three-phase process (see Figure~\ref{fig:project-lifecycle}). First, project stakeholders initiate the
project. Next, the project team executes the project and monitors its progress. Finally, once the project reaches its
end, it is formally closed.

These three phases are covered in detail in the next sections.
