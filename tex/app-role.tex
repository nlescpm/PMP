\section{Role of PMs and others in external and Ambition 2 projects}
\label{app:pm-role}

This section focuses speficially on the role and involvement of the PM team in Fellowship,
External, KD, SS and D\&C projects.


\subsection{Fellowship projects}
Funded through the calls budget, Fellowship projects differ in purpose and organization from regular 
call projects. CMs are responsible for these projects, and a PM assigned by the PM team is advising them.

\subsection{External projects}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,ref=\arabic*]
\item Acquisition
\begin{itemize}
\item The eScience Center staff must follow the external funding policy and seek permission before pursuing an acquisition opportunity, in consultation with a PM.
\item During this consultation, the PM  must be informed of:
\begin{itemize}
\item estimated workload in person-hours
\item team composition and whether the person submissing the proposal  intends to serve as Lead RSE
\item timeline of the proposal/project
\end{itemize}
\item The PM can advise the Lead RSE on the proposal. If the advice is critical, the PM informs the PD. 
If additional (temporary) capacity is needed, the PM contacts the relevant SH. 
Note: planning remains provisional at this stage.
\end{itemize}
\item Preparation of project – call/subsidy projects
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lead RSE informs the PD, Finance, PM, SH, and relevant parties immediately upon granting confirmation.
\item The PD, Finance, and Lead RSE handle grant, consortium agreements, and project start documents.
\item The PM agrees on planning with the Lead RSE and the project team, and puts it in Ganttic.
\end{itemize}
\item Preparation of project – contract projects
\begin{itemize}
\item The Lead RSE and Finance arrange the contract, the Lead RSE keeps the PM informed of start dates.
\item The PM agrees on planning with the Lead RSE and the project team, and records it in Ganttic
\end{itemize}
\item During the project
\begin{itemize}
\item See the protocol for the relevant parts. The PM acts in consulting role and Lead RSE is
accountable.
\end{itemize}
\item Reporting
\begin{itemize}
\item As noted in Section~\ref{sec:exec:report}, the PM reviews the report. The Lead RSE or the grant applicant is responsible for obtaining the financial report from Finance and sending it to the external coordinator.
\end{itemize}
\item Closing of project
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead RSE informs PM of closing of project for funder or end of contract
\item PM follows formal closing steps as described by Section \ref{sec:closing}.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}




\subsection{KD and SS projects}
The process for KD and SS projects is fully described by the KD and SS protocols~\cite{intranet}, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.,ref=\arabic*]
\item Call and selection
\begin{itemize}
\item Follows the protocol
\item Upon granting, DoT or TLs inform Finance (cc PMs) which projects to create in Exact.
\end{itemize}
\item Preparation of the project
\begin{itemize}
\item The PM formally assigns the Lead RSE, discusses planning with the team, and enters it in Ganttic.
\end{itemize}
\item During the project
\begin{itemize}
\item The PM is not directly involved in the project unless requested by Lead RSE.
\end{itemize}
\item Reporting
\begin{itemize}
\item The extent of reporting is decided upon by DoT and TLs.
\end{itemize}
\item Closing of project
\begin{itemize}
\item Lead RSE informs PM of closing of project
\item PM follows formal closing steps, as described in Section \ref{sec:closing}.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{D\&C projects}
D\&C projects for external funding follow the same process as other external projects.

The process for the D\&C projects for training and workshops is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*),ref=\arabic*]
\item Each October, the D\&C training lead provides SHs and PMs with an overview of training hours, including estimates for externally funded trainings.
\item SHs coordinate with RSEs on next year's training plans, ensuring total hours match D\&C projects needs. SHs share the planning 
with PMs and the training lead, and PMs incorporate it into projects planning.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.,ref=\alph*]
\item If training activities put project progress at risk, the PM alerts the SH. Together, they decide whether to reassign the training or the project to another RSE.
\end{enumerate}
\item During the year
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.,ref=\alph*]
\item If an RSE exceeds their agreed upon training hours, the SH is responsible for discussing this
issue with the RSE and taking appropriate measures.
\item If a project is (unexpectedly) progressing unsatisfactory due to the RSE involved in training,
the PM discusses this with the SH and the RSE and takes appropriate measures.
\item If requests for externally funded training exceed the annual estimate, the training lead consults PMs on scheduling before deciding to give the training.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
